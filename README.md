# eCommerce-Chatbot using LangGraph (Verta)


## Introduction

The **Verta Chatbot** project is a sophisticated AI-driven solution designed to enhance user interactions with product information. Deployed as a serverless **FASTAPI** API on **Cloud Run**, it serves users by answering questions about products, leveraging both metadata and user reviews for context. The chatbot utilizes a multi-agent workflow, with distinct agents performing specialized roles. A **Metadata Agent** is responsible for summarizing product descriptions, while a **Retriever Agent** fetches relevant data from a vector store containing user reviews. This allows the chatbot to answer a wide range of user inquiries, drawing on both product details and feedback from other customers.

The database for this solution is hosted on **PostgreSQL** in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, ensuring scalable, reliable storage. The project utilizes **CI/CD pipelines** via **GitHub Actions**, automating code deployment and ensuring seamless integration and delivery. Additionally, the system incorporates **LLM-as-Judge** to generate synthetic test questions for a set of products, while **bias detection** algorithms analyze potential biases in the chatbot's responses to ensure fairness and accuracy.

Experiment tracking is managed through **MLflow**, which captures model performance and experiment metadata, while **Langfuse** is used for tracing user interactions and gathering feedback to continuously improve the system. For monitoring and alerting, **GCP Logs** are utilized with notifications configured to send alerts to a **Teams channel** for real-time system health checks.

The chatbot’s data orchestration is powered by **Apache Airflow**, while **FaisDB** is used as the vector store for storing product reviews and context. The system integrates three LLMs — **GPT-4o-Mini**, **Llama 3.1-70B**, and **Llama 3.1-8B** — running on four nodes to support its operations. The chatbot’s multi-agent flow is managed using **LangGraph**, a framework for orchestrating complex workflows. For ease of use, the chatbot is also available as a **Streamlit web app**, with integration capabilities for custom frontends via API, secured using **Auth Bearer Tokens**.
